# Code In Place Final Project

### Uploaded within this repository is my submission of a final project for Stanford's Code In Place short course.

From late April to early June, we've helped Karel solve several challenges. We've created functions that can double numbers and lists; we've drawn flags and created our own mad libs games. 
There was even our own Joke Bot and forum quilt.

## This program is designed to simulate a log-in page for an inspirational quote site. 

The user will read the printed statements, log in to the portal, input desired choices (in which the beginning letters are not necessarily case-sensitive), and receive some 
inspirational quotes shamelessly copied from https://www.brainyquote.com/

Primary skills displayed: 

- Print
- If, Else, Elif Statements
- Nesting Statements
- Lists
- Random Library
- User Input & Output
- For Loop
- i and range
- Learning a bit of Markdown :smiley:
